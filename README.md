Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================
This repo is used to prepare a tidy data set for the course project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Cousera. The raw data used in the analysis could be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

There are three files in this repo:
* run_analysis.R contains all the code used to prepare the data set. 
* CodeBook.md describes the steps to the final data along with some explanation of the variables, the data and the transformations.
* mean_std_average_data.txt is the final tidy data created by the analysis code.
